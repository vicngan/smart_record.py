# Victoria Matcha Café Asset Pack

This folder contains Figma/dev-ready vector assets that match the cozy matcha café aesthetic described in the blueprint.

## Structure

- `illustrations/`
  - `victoria_matcha_muse.svg` — primary hero portrait with halo, matcha cup, and sparkles.
  - `matcha_workspace_scene.svg` — desk scene for secondary hero or About section backgrounds.
- `stickers/`
  - `matcha_cup_glow.svg` — floating cup sticker with glow for buttons or chip accents.
  - `matcha_leaf_duo.svg` — leafy badge for section headings or cards.
- `overlays/`
  - `steam_drift_loop.svg` — vertical steam ribbons (use as mask or reference).
  - `steam_drift_loop.json` — Lottie animation for looping steam drift (30fps, 320×640).
  - `matcha_particles_overlay.svg` — subtle dot texture; set to Screen/Soft Light in Figma.
  - `matcha_particles_overlay.json` — Lottie animation for floating particles (30fps, 640×640).
  - `watercolor_brushstroke.svg` — soft gradient swipe to place behind headings.
- `mockups/`
  - `project_device_mockup.svg` — laptop + phone mock to showcase project screenshots.

## Usage Tips

- Import SVGs directly into Figma; enable “Fill” editing to tweak gradients if needed.
- For motion prototypes, convert `steam_drift_loop.svg` paths into animated strokes or hand off as reference for After Effects/Lottie.
- Lottie files (`*.json`) can be dropped into Figma, LottieFiles, or web apps via `lottie-web`. They loop seamlessly; keep playback speed between 0.8–1.0 for gentle movement.
- Overlays are designed to sit at 5–15% opacity with blend modes (`Screen`, `Overlay`, or `Soft Light`) for gentle texture.
- Stickers double as iconography; keep them at 64–160px for crisp edges.
- The mockup frame fits 16:9 screenshots (1840×1035) and 9:19.5 mobile shots (1170×2532). Clip your project images inside the white screens.

Let me know if you want alternate colorways, PNG exports, or animated GIF/Lottie versions.***
